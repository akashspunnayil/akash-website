    I am a multidisciplinary scientist with over 7 years of experience in **physical oceanography**, 
    **biogeochemical modeling**, and **data science consulting**. My work bridges academic research and 
    applied analytics, focusing on climate‚Äìocean dynamics, dissolved oxygen variability, and actionable 
    insights from complex datasets.

    ### üî¨ Academic & Research Focus
    - Ocean-climate interactions: **OMZ dynamics**, **upwelling**, **circulation**, **ENSO/IOD impacts**
    - Biogeochemical and physical modeling using **HYCOM-ECOSMO**
    - High-resolution data analysis using **in-situ**, **reanalysis**, and **remote sensing** datasets

    ### üß† Data Science & Programming
    - Machine learning (XGBoost, Random Forests, GAMs) for predictive modeling
    - HPC, automation, and custom scripting in **Python, R, FORTRAN**
    - Interactive dashboards and visualization workflows

    ### üíº Freelance Consulting Services
    As a consultant, I‚Äôve delivered custom **data analytics solutions** and **scientific scripting support** 
    to M.Sc., Ph.D. students, and researchers across domains such as:
    - **Environmental and climate research**
    - **Water quality and fisheries analytics**
    - **Health and medical risk modeling**
    - **Business and geospatial insights**

    **Recent Projects** include:
    - *Air Pollution Hotspot Tool*: Ranking cities using percentile-based exposure logic  
    - *Catch Prediction Models*: AI-driven models for fishery productivity and effort optimization  
    - *Diabetes Risk Classifier*: ML-based PDF health report generator  
    - *Sea Level Trend Detector*: Sliding window tool for spatial sea level trend mapping  
    - *argohycom-toolbox*: Python module for collocating BGC-Argo profiles with HYCOM model outputs
