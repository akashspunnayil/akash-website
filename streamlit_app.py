    My doctoral research focuses on the **interplay between ocean physics and biogeochemistry** in shaping the Oxygen Minimum Zone (OMZ) in the Arabian Sea. By combining **numerical modeling**, **observational data**, and **machine learning**, I aim to uncover key mechanisms behind OMZ variability and its ecological implications.

    ### üß™ Core Research Themes
    - **Seasonal and interannual OMZ variability** in the Arabian Sea  
    - Influence of **climate drivers** such as ENSO and IOD on ocean oxygenation  
    - **Circulation and scalar transport diagnostics** using HYCOM-ECOSMO outputs  
    - Vertical and lateral export of **oxygen, detritus, nitrate** through undercurrents and offshore jets  
    - Role of **intermediate water masses and upwelling** in biogeochemical redistribution  

    ### üìä Modeling Tools & Approaches
    - High-resolution simulations with **HYCOM-ECOSMO** for coupled physical-biogeochemical analysis  
    - Development of a **physics-informed OMZ Intensity Index**  
    - Scalar transport estimators for oxygen, detritus, nitrate, and phytoplankton  
    - **Hovm√∂ller-style diagrams**, seasonal climatologies, and transport cross-sections  

    ### ü§ñ AI & Machine Learning in Ocean Science
    - Application of **XGBoost**, **Random Forests**, and **GAM models** to predict:
        - OMZ structure and seasonal shifts  
        - Myctophid catch and biomass based on ecological predictors  
    - Feature engineering from ocean circulation, productivity, and oxygen gradients
